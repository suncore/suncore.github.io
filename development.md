## Cero Development

You are welcome to participate in Cero development. Discussions are held in the forum (see Community link) and the sources are on GitHub (see top blue "View on GitHub" link).

Some serious effort is needed in the tooling domain, such as support in Eclipse, Kdevelop etc.

### Building

Currently, only Linux is supported.

Get sources from GitHub (git clone or download zip). Just run "make" to build.
