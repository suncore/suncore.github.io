## Cero Development

You are welcome to participate in Cero development. Sources are on GitHub (see top blue "View on GitHub" link).

Effort is needed in the tooling domain, such as support in Eclipse, Kdevelop etc.

If you want to contact the author of Cero, send me a mail at [henrik@harmsen.se](mailto:henrik@harmsen.se)

### Building

Currently, only Linux is supported.

Get sources from GitHub (git clone or download zip). Just run "make" to build.
