<h2>Why Cero?</h2>

<p>Well, why not?</p>

<p>Cero is an experiment trying to find a language that is comfortable to use and also has maximum execution speed and support for modern parallelism such as vector/SIMD and GPU systems. Other languages e.g. Rust and Go are very interesting but currently only C++ has the needed support and is truly industrial strength. C++ also allows me to do low level programming without any harness which I find to be fun and where I think there are still new things to discover e.g. in the domains of machine learning and AI, 3D games, compression algorithms, etc. </p>

<p>I have some dark opinions on the way C++ has evolved over the years, but C++11 makes it a lot more interesting and Cero is an attempt for me to try to like it even more... Who knows where this may lead...</p>

<p>(Yes, I know the world really does NOT need another programming language, but think of this as a mod to an existing one, not a new one. ;-)</p>
